At the time of formation, the range is considered flat. After the breakout, depending on which direction the breakout was in, this range is considered bullish or bearish. It is possible to set filters by maximum volume and number of bars in the range.\n</div>\n</div><hr><p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/72076265173/original/ArUbUup6Ef5wsQvxwz3aGKIbQskzAow1ig.png?1701793392\"></p><p>To add and set up the indicator, open the <a href=\"https://help.atas.net/en/support/solutions/articles/72000602613\">Indicators settings window</a>.</p><p><br></p><h2>Indicator's settings<em><br></em></h2><div><div>\n<h3>Calculation</h3>\n<table>\n<tbody><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Days look back</td>\n<td>Refers to the number of previous days taken into account when calculating an indicator.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3>Volume filter</h3>\n<table>\n<tbody><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Filter</td>\n<td>Maximum volumes greater than the value set in this filter will be ignored.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hide All</td>\n<td>Determines whether to hide ranges that do not pass the maximum volume filter.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3>Bars count filter</h3>\n<table>\n<tbody><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Filter</td>\n<td>This property is used to specify the number of candles that should be aggregated before the main calculation takes place.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hide All</td>\n<td>Determines whether to hide ranges that do not pass the bars count filter.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3>Visualization</h3>\n<table>\n<tbody><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Break Up Color</td>\n<td>Sets the color for elements with a bullish direction.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Maximum Volume Color</td>\n<td>Sets the color for elements with maximum volume.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Break Dn Color</td>\n<td>Sets the color for elements with a bearish direction.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Flat Color</td>\n<td>Sets the color for elements with a neutral direction.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Width</td>\n<td>Defines the thickness of lines or elements in the chart</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n</div>\n</div>\n            \n\n          ",
