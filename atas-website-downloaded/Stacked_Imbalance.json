It provides insight into potential areas of interest for traders based on differences in volume. The magnitude of the imbalance is determined as a percentage of the compared volumes. For example, let's analyze the value of 30 ask and the value of the overweight of 350%, 350% of 30 = 105, in order for the cluster to be highlighted, the bid must be more than 105.\n</div>\n</div><hr><figure><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/72077065793/original/OCmDoGnz1pyXuBEpViTFXTyeizXb4tolLQ.png\"></figure><p>To add and set up the indicator, open the <a href=\"https://help.atas.net/en/support/solutions/articles/72000602613\">Indicators settings window</a>.</p><p><br></p><h2>Indicator's settings<em><br></em></h2><div><div>\n<h3>Settings</h3>\n<table>\n<tbody><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ignore zero values</td>\n<td>If enabled, zero values are not included in the calculations.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Imbalance Ratio</td>\n<td>Defines the minimum value of the ratio.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Imbalance Range</td>\n<td>Defines the minimum number of levels in a given range.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Imbalance Volume</td>\n<td>Volumes that are less than the value set in this filter will be ignored.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3>Calculation</h3>\n<table>\n<tbody><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Days look back</td>\n<td>Refers to the number of previous days taken into account when calculating an indicator.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3>Drawing</h3>\n<table>\n<tbody><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Line till touch</td>\n<td>Determines whether to extend the line until it touches the bar.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ask/Bid Imbalance Color</td>\n<td>Sets the color for elements with a bullish direction.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bid/Ask Imbalance Color</td>\n<td>Sets the color for elements with a bearish direction.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Line width</td>\n<td>Determines the width of the displayed line.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Print line for X bars</td>\n<td>Determines the length of the displayed line.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3>Alerts</h3>\n<table>\n<tbody><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Signal alert</td>\n<td>Determines whether to issue an alert when a specified signal appears.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Approximation alert</td>\n<td>Determines whether an alert is issued when the price approaches a certain level.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Alert File</td>\n<td>This parameter allows users to specify the name of a custom audio file for alert sounds.
